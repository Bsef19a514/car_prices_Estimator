# car_prices_predictor

The main file name is "app.py" which imports another file named as 
“until.py" which further imports “columns.json" and
"car price estimation" files. 
There are two other files named "index.html" and "styles.css" 
which serves as the front-end part of my ML model. 
Their is an other file named "car price estimation.ipynb"
In this file I actually trained my machine learning model
using linear regression.
